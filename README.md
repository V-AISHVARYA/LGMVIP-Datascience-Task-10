# ML Facial recognition to detect mood and suggest songs accordingly.

This project combines machine learning techniques to detect emotions from facial expressions and recommend suitable songs based on the detected mood. The system utilizes a dataset of grayscale facial images, each labeled with one of seven emotion categories: Angry, Disgust, Fear, Happy, Sad, Surprise, and Neutral.

## Project Overview
The project involves the following steps:

1. **Data Collection and Preprocessing:**
   - The dataset consists of 48x48 pixel grayscale images of faces.
   - Images have been pre-registered and centered to ensure consistency.
   
2. **Model Training:**
   - A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is trained to recognize emotions from facial features.
   - The model is built using a deep learning framework (e.g., TensorFlow or PyTorch).
   - Data augmentation techniques are employed to enhance model generalization.
   - A pre-trained CNN architecture (e.g., VGG, ResNet) can be fine-tuned for emotion classification.

3. **Emotion Detection:**
   - The trained model detects emotions in facial images and classifies them into one of the seven predefined emotion categories.
   
4. **Music Recommendation:**
   - Emotions are mapped to corresponding music genres or styles.
   - A database of songs tagged with the appropriate mood is used for recommendations.
   
5. **User Interaction:**
   - Users can upload facial images to have their emotions detected.
   - The system suggests songs that match the detected mood.

6. **Ethical Considerations:**
   - Privacy concerns and potential biases in emotion detection are addressed.
   - User consent is obtained for image usage.
   - Bias in predictions is actively monitored and mitigated.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
   
2. Install the required dependencies using `requirements.txt`.
   
3. Preprocess the dataset:
   - Resize images to a common size (e.g., 224x224) and normalize pixel values.
   
4. Train the emotion detection model:
   - Define the CNN architecture and train the model on the preprocessed dataset.
   
5. Deploy the model:
   - Integrate the trained model into an application or platform to allow users to upload images and receive music recommendations.

## Usage

1. Upload an image:
   - Provide an image containing a facial expression to the deployed system.
   
2. Emotion detection:
   - The system will detect the emotion in the image and classify it into one of the seven emotion categories.
   
3. Music recommendation:
   - Based on the detected emotion, the system will suggest suitable songs from the database.

## Feedback

We welcome feedback to improve the accuracy of emotion detection and the quality of music recommendations. Please provide feedback on predictions and song suggestions to help us continually refine the system.
